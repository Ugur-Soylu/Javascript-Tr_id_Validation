Task : Find out the most frequent number and its frequency.

Write a program that;
We will do a TR ID no validation study.
For this, we will take the relevant value from the user via
input (as in the mail validation section) and 
perform validation control using the necessary regex pattern and if necessary conditions.
We will make the styling changes of the warning messages in the span
through the CSS classes we have defined (class change). (use of classList or className).

Javascript TR Identity Number Verification Algorithm will also be as follows.
Rules of the algorithm
+TR ID numbers consist of 11 digits.
+An algorithm established between the first 9 digits gives us the 10th step,
and an algorithm established between the first 10 digits gives us the 11th step.
Each digit contains a numerical value.
The first digit cannot be 0.
When the sum of the 1st, 5th, 7th and 9th digits is 7 times the sum of the 2nd, 4th, 6th and 8th digits, the remainder of the division by 10, that is, Mod10, gives us the 10th digit.
1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. The remainder of the division by 10 of the sum of the 9th and 10th digits, that is Mod10, gives us the 11th digit.
